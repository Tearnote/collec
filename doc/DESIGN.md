# Collec - UX design notes

## Motivation

The need to track collections is universal. People want to track music they own to make it easier to manage their collection, keep a wishlist, or organize albums they want to sell. Others want to track all music they listened to, because they find themselves forgetting what they already checked out in the past. The same need arises for fans of videogames, movies, TV shows, or any number of more specialized or esoteric hobbies.

Countless applications and online services have popped up to answer this need, and many of them are enjoying high popularity and have thriving communities. However, they are highly specialized, and often offer features that most users aren't interested in interacting with. There is a need for simpler solutions that can track multiple kinds of collections in a unified interface.
