# Collec: a collection tracker webapp

*Collec* is a webapp for tracking several types of collections. It was originally made for [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/)'s 4th submission project.

## Important notes

The documentation is split across two files:

-   [README.md](README.md) (this file): Overview of the app. Read this to get an idea of the premise of the app, technologies used and project conventions.
-   [DESIGN.md](doc/DESIGN.md): UX design notes crafting during early stages of development. The design process is described entirely, from the concept and market research, through information structuring to visual design principles and color palettes.

The project is managed via a [GitHub project](https://github.com/users/Tearnote/projects/1/views/1). Issues are created in a "User story" format, and assigned size/complexity and importance. Each issue contains a title, user story sentence, and a list of technical expectations.

## Technologies used

-   Python 3: Used for the backend portion of the app
-   HTML5+CSS3: Design of the frontend

## Dependencies

All dependencies are included, or installed via requirements.txt.

-   [Django 4.1](https://www.djangoproject.com): backend framework used to serve the app to the browser and as a RESTful interface to manipulate the models
-   [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com): CSS framework for grid layout and improved based styles
-   [django-crispy-forms](https://github.com/django-crispy-forms/django-crispy-forms): Django library that improves form rendering
-   [django-allauth](https://www.intenct.nl/projects/django-allauth/): Django library that expands on the built-in user authentication
